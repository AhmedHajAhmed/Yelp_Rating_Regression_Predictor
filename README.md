# Yelp_Rating_Regression_Predictor

<img src="Yelp_logo.png" >


The restaurant industry is tougher than ever, with restaurant reviews blazing across the internet from day one of a restaurant's opening. Since a restaurant's success is highly correlated with its reputation, in this project, I'll discover what makes a restaurant gets the best reviews on the most queried restaurant review site, Yelp. With a dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp ratings, I will load, merge, clean, analyze the data and then use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant's Yelp rating.

In this project I'll be working with datasets provided by Yelp: 
* `yelp_business.json`: establishment data regarding location and attributes for all businesses in the dataset
* `yelp_review.json`: Yelp review metadata by business
* `yelp_user.json`: user profile metadata by business
* `yelp_checkin.json`: online checkin metadata by business
* `yelp_tip.json`: tip metadata by business
* `yelp_photo.json`: photo metadata by business

For detailed explanation of the features in each `.json` file, see the accompanying [feature_descriptions](https://github.com/AhmedHajAhmed/Yelp_Rating_Regression_Predictor/blob/main/feature_descriptions).
